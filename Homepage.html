                <h2>Why the name?</h2>
                <p>
                    HobPot stands for 'Humanity Is Obliviously Blinded To Powers Of Ten', weren't expecting that weren't you? Though this seemingly random phrase that I keep thinking about holds so much inner meaning that it makes up for its strange wording.
                    <h3>The number system</h3>
                    <p>
                        as humans, our thinking is often biased towards thinking in our base-10 system. After all, thats why stores marker prices one unit less than the actual price, as any power of ten seems like a significant change. We forget that the decimal system means nothing to the actual universe, and it is a figment of our imagination inherited by our ancestors, neither effective nor efficient.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The box</h3>
                    <p>
                        The box is a metaphor for our limited perspective, where we often confine ourselves to familiar concepts and frameworks. This blog aims to break out of that box, encouraging exploration beyond conventional boundaries and embracing the vastness of knowledge and creativity. By thinking outside the box, I hope to make this blog a space for innovation.

                <h2>Section 3 Placeholder</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a placeholder for the third section of the homepage. This section could feature a specific
                    project, a call to action, or a showcase of your best content. Think about what you want visitors to do
                    after reading the first two sections and design this section accordingly. Use strong visuals and clear
                    language to guide them towards your desired outcome. The interplay between design and technology is
                    crucial in shaping our modern world, and this blog aims to explore that relationship in depth.

                <h2>Section 4 Placeholder</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a placeholder for the fourth section of the homepage. This area could be used for testimonials,
                    a contact form, or a list of resources. Consider what would be most valuable to your audience and
                    incorporate it here. Make sure to keep the design consistent with the rest of the page and use clear
                    calls to action to encourage engagement.

                    The human experience is at the heart of everything we do, and
                    this blog seeks to understand and enhance that experience through thoughtful design and innovative
                    technology. The image to the right demonstrates how visuals can complement and enhance written content, making the reading experience more engaging and informative.
