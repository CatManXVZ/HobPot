  "body": "/c javascript Based on your current code, here are other potential issues and improvements unrelated to the code block preview handler:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Multiple Preview Handlers**\nYou still have multiple `bodyInput.addEventListener('input', ...)` handlers for different features (basic markup, code, images). This can cause race conditions, flicker, or inconsistent preview rendering, even if the code block logic is correct.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **/c ... / Regex Only Matches Single Line**\nYour current `/c ... /` regex is:\n```js\nhtml = html.replace(/\\/c\\s*([^\\n\\/]+)\\s*\\//g, (match, codeText) => {\n    return `<pre><code>${codeText.replace(/</g, '&lt;').replace(/>/g, '&gt;')}</code></pre>`;\n});\n```\nThis only matches a single line of code, not multiline code blocks. If you want multiline support, you need `/[\\s\\S]*?/` instead of `/[^\\n\\/]+/`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **No `/c language ... /` Support in Main Preview**\nYour main preview handler (lines 281â€“294) does not support `/c language ... /` code blocks. Only a later handler does, so if the main handler runs last, it will overwrite the correct rendering.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Image Preview Handlers Are Duplicated**\nYou have several handlers for `/pic ... /` image preview, each with slightly different logic. This can cause inconsistent rendering and unnecessary network requests.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Order of Replacements**\nIf you do `/c ... /` before `/c language ... /`, the generic handler will eat the language-specific one. Always do `/c language ... /` first.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Performance: Multiple Async Handlers**\nYou have several async preview handlers that fetch images on every keystroke. This can cause lag, race conditions, and unnecessary server load.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Potential for Event Handler Leaks**\nIf you re-initialize or reload parts of the DOM, you may end up with duplicate event handlers, causing multiple triggers for a single event.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **No Syntax Highlighting Trigger**\nIf you use Prism.js for syntax highlighting, you need to call `Prism.highlightAll()` after updating the preview, or the code blocks will not be highlighted.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **No Error Handling for Image Fetch**\nIf the image fetch fails, you may get an empty preview or JS errors.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **No Escaping for Other Markup**\nIf users enter HTML or special characters outside code blocks, they may not be escaped, leading to XSS or broken previews.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of what to fix:**\n- Unify all preview logic into a single handler.\n- Use robust regex for code blocks (multiline, language support).\n- Always call `Prism.highlightAll()` after updating the preview.\n- Optimize image fetching (cache or debounce).\n- Escape user input outside code blocks.\n- Remove duplicate/obsolete handlers.\n\nIf you want, I can  /   ",
